## Browser Camera Access

If you get the error message **Camera Access Required** trying to scan a QR code with your camera, it's because your default settings for browser camera access are set to "Deny" or you possibly mistakenly denied access when first prompted by the application. To allow camera access, follow the steps below for your device/browser.

## iOS (iPhone/iPad)

### Safari

1. Tap on <span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">`aA`</span> on the left of the address bar
2. Select `Website Settings`
3. Tap on `Camera` and select `Allow` (or `Ask`)
4. Tap `Done`

### Chrome/Firefox

For ***website*** access to the camera, Chrome/Firefox will prompt you every time you press the camera button until you allow access. However, for this to work, you must first allow **that browser** access to the camera in iOS (your iPhone/iPad). If you denied access, Chrome/Firefox will not prompt you again. To allow access to the camera to the browser follow these steps:

1. Open the `Settings` app
2. Scroll to and tap `Privacy`
3. Tap `Camera`
4. Scroll to `Chrome` (or `Firefox`) and make sure the switch is on (green)

When done, go back to Chrome/FireFox and tap on the camera button again in **VaxCheck** and you should be prompted to allow access. Select `Allow`.

### Special Considerations

If you add the application to your home screen, you must ensure the camera setting for `OTHER WEBSITES` is **not** set to `Deny`. This is true even if you allowed access to the `vaxcheck.app` domain in Safari. To change this setting, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Settings` app
2. Scroll down to `Safari`
3. Scroll down to the `SETTINGS FOR WEBSITES` section and select `Camera`
4. Under `OTHER WEBSITES` select `Ask` (**IMPORTANT: Do NOT select `Allow` here as it will give any website you visit implicit access to your camera which is not something I would recommend anyone does EVER.** )

## Android (Phone/Tablet)

**NOTE:** I only have an old Amazon Fire tablet with the Silk browser (based on Chromium). If anyone wants to provide instructions for Android browsers feel free to send them my way.

### Silk/Chromium

To enable website camera access in Silk on a Fire Tablet, follow these steps:

1. Tap on the ‚ö†Ô∏è icon in the address bar
2. Tap on `Site settings`
3. Tap on `Access your camera`
4. Select `Allow`

**NOTE:** These may work on other Chromium-based (e.g. Chrome) browsers in Android. Your mileage may vary.

## Desktop

### Safari (Mac)

On the desktop, if you select "Don't Allow" when prompted for camera access in Safari, you can simply click again on the VaxCheck camera icon and you will get prompted again. If you selected "Never For This Website", follow these steps to re-enable camera access for the website:

1. Right-click on the address bar and select `Settings for This Website...`
  Alternatively, select `Safari` in the menu bar then `Settings for This Website...`
2. Set **Camera** to `Allow` (or `Ask`)

### Chrome (Mac/Windows)

To enable website camera access in Chrome on desktop, follow these steps:

1. Click on the üîí icon in the address bar
2. Select `Site settings`
3. Select `Allow` (or `Ask`) for **Camera**

### FireFox (Mac/Windows)

To enable website camera access in Chrome on desktop, follow these steps:

1. Click on the üìπ (video camera) icon in the address bar
2. Click on `Blocked Temporarily` (or `Blocked`)

Click on the VaxCheck camera button again and select `Allow`.
