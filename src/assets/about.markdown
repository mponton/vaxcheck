## VaxCheck v1.0.0

### Background

In Quebec (Canada) we got our COVID-19 proof of vaccination QR codes starting in May 2021. At the time of writing in early August 2021 there was still no official application to decode the QR codes and there was already a lot of noise in the media about its content, privacy issues, ease of decoding and fake passes. I was curious to know the content of this QR code and how validation worked. At the same time I had a few days off and an interest in learning [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/), [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) and frontend Javascript development. It was a good excuse to get my hands dirty.

I created version 1.0.0 of this application from scratch in ~3 days. I already knew JavaScript but had never worked with Quasar and Vue.JS nor used any of the JavaScript libraries needed for this project. Of course, I knew nothing about the QR codes formats.

After spending enough time on this, although I suspect some of my code may make real frontend developers' eyes bleed, I decided to open-source it and publish it on GitHub Pages. I'll probably keep updating it for a while if time allows and interest does not wane.

### Implementation Details

If you are technically inclined or just curious, the source code for this application is available freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/mponton/vaxcheck) and the README file contains a lot more information.

### About Me

I started playing with computers on a Commodore VIC-20 and then on my trusty 4MHz (8Mhz Turbo Mode!) Intel 8088 IBM Compatible with a large 40MB hard drive and CGA graphics adapter. I started coding on an Intel 80386 but although I made it a professional career for a while, I switched to doing consulting work in IT infrastructure since 1999. During these years I never stopped coding but it was rarely my bread and butter.
